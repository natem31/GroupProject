# Athlete Scheduler: Smart Time Management for Student-Athletes: Sam Harris and Nate Mueller

## Big Idea / Goal / Why Did We Do This?

As student-athletes, we face constant pressure to balance academics, athletics, rest, and social life — often within a packed and unforgiving schedule. With this in mind, we set out to build **Athlete Scheduler**, a smart, personalized scheduling tool designed specifically to help student-athletes optimize their weekly routines. Our goal was to reduce stress and decision fatigue by automating the scheduling of flexible activities like studying, meals, and sleep around fixed commitments such as classes, practices, and lifts. The scheduler provides users with a clean, categorized weekly plan that reflects their priorities and obligations, giving them more control over how they spend their limited time. By using our own real schedules as input, we ensured the app was both practical and realistic for others in similar situations.

## User Instructions
To use Athlete Scheduler you need a to use this key 47c2f0df9d7b8b0632e47e85452b9116 you also need all of the necessary libraries under requirements.txt. From there users can access the app by runing the code and input their class times, practices and other events and recieve a personalized weekely plan. 

## Results
The final product is a functioning web application that takes in a user’s weekly commitments and generates a dynamic, color-coded schedule designed to optimize time use. Our prototype successfully creates a plan that includes fixed and flexible obligations, clearly distinguishes between categories (like academics, athletics, and rest), and provides a visual output that users can easily follow. In testing the app with our own schedules, we found it helpful in reducing the time we usually spend manually planning our weeks. Screenshots and a demo video are available in the project repository to showcase these capabilities.

## Project Evolution / Narrative

We followed our proposed schedule fairly closely throughout the development of Athlete Scheduler. Sticking to our plan allowed us to stay organized and steadily build each component of the project. Looking ahead, we hope to expand the application by collecting usage data from users’ calendars. This would allow us to analyze time management patterns and provide even stronger, data-driven suggestions for how student-athletes can fill in schedule gaps and optimize their routines more effectively.
